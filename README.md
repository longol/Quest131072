# Speed 2048
Speed 2048 is a fast-paced, time-challenge twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game. Race against the clock to merge matching tiles, overcome strategic penalties, and reach the coveted 2048 tile in record time!

## Overview
Speed 2048 reimagines the popular 2048 game with added speed and strategy elements. Every second counts as you combine tiles to achieve higher values, while special moves like undo and force-tile add an extra layer of challenge. Built with SwiftUI, the game features fluid animations, responsive controls, and multiple game levels to suit players of all skill levels.

## Features
- **Timed Gameplay:** A built-in timer keeps track of your progress as you race against the clock.
- **Multiple Game Levels:** Choose from different modes (e.g., Regular, Easy, Only 2s, Only 4s) that adjust the challenge and penalty dynamics.
- **Undo & Special Moves:** Recover from mistakes with an undo option or add a powerful tile at the cost of extra time.
- **SwiftUI-Powered Interface:** Enjoy a modern, responsive design with smooth animations.
- **Local Game State Storage:** High scores, game state, and timing data are saved locally for a seamless experience.
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor your progress with in-game stats and timing metrics.
